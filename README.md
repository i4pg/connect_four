## Description

>  Connect Four is a two-player game connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. - Wikipedia.

Using Test Driven Development style, this game is developed with Ruby. RSpec is used for TDD. TDD is in simple terms, figuring out what needs to happen, writing a failing test for it, then writing the code to make that test pass and then refactoring the code.
